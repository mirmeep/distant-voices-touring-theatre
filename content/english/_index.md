  - title: "Distant Voices"
    image: "/images/service-1.png"
    content: "The Distant Voices production is based on the diaries of Hiroaki Nishimura written during his experiences when he was incarcerated in the Japanese American Concentration Camps of World War II.  In his later years Hiroaki translated his journals into English for his daughter, Julie Nishimura. From those journals comes a powerful story that will keep audiences thinking long after the performance has ended.  
Hiroaki's daughter, Julie, and her husband, playwright Danny Peak, created Distant Voices, a spoken performance set to music, to tell Hiroaki's story and to ensure that this dark period in American history is never forgotten."

    content: "September Echoes is an original play written by Danny Peak, who was a champion of social justice.  Based on interviews with people in the aftermath of the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, this production is a harsh reminder of how human rights and dignity can be stripped from people simply because of how they worship, the color of their skin and the way that they dress."
