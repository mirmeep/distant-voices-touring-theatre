    content: "Danny was the founder and co-artistic director of DVTT.  He was a champion of social justice, gearing much of his work toward involving people whose voices are often overlooked and to helping increase awareness of the struggles of the underserved in our communities and society as a whole.  Danny wrote the original scripts for both Distant Voices and September Echoes and he was the spoken voice of Hiroaki  in our Distant Voices production.  In addition to the shows, Danny held workshops in schools prior to and after performances to encourage open-mindedness and tolerance in the kids with whom he interacted.  He held lively discussions with audiences in other venues after performances.  This is a tradition we keep in his honor.  He was beloved by the children he worked with and by the many whose lives he touched.  We miss him every day."
